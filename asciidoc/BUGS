1. AsciiDoc

     * A benign warning with will become a reserved keyword in Python 2.6
       sometimes occurs when using Python 2.5 -- it's harmless and will
       disappear with Python 3.
     * The toc attribute will be ignored if it's set in a custom user or
       document configuration file. This is because the default
       configuration file containing the document [header] is sourced
       before custom configuration files and the toc attribute is
       processed using conditional inclusion macros.
     * Reported line numbers in diagnostic messages are sometimes wrong.
     * Embedding open brace characters { in argument values can cause
       incorrect argument substitution.
     * Attribute references in macro attribute lists can't be unescaped
       (with the exception of attribute list entry {0}).
     * Section numbering is incorrect when outputting HTML from a
       multi-part book type document. This is not a biggy since multi-part
       books are generally processed to DocBook.
     * A row of apostrophes in an inline context throws AsciiDoc into an
       endless loop.
     * Multiple comma separated command names in the manpage NAME section
       translate to a single DocBook refname instead of multiple refname
       elements.
     * Escaping quoted text and macros is sometimes tricky owing to some
       macro and quoting ambiguities.
