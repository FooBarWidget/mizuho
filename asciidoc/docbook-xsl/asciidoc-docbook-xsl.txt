AsciiDoc DocBook XSL Stylesheets Notes
======================================

PDF generation from AsciiDoc generated DocBook using FOP plus DocBook XSL
Stylesheets.

- FOP 0.95beta.
- DocBook XSL Stylesheets version 1.74.0.

Output file customisation is achieved by tweaking the DocBook XSL
stylesheets.  I've tried to keep customization to a minimum and
confine it to the separate XSL driver files in the distribution
`./docbook-xsl/` directory (see the User Guide for details).

To polish some rough edges I've written some patches for the DocBook
XSL stylesheets -- you don't need them but they're documented below
and included in the distribution `./docbook-xsl/` directory.


Manually upgrading Debian to the latest DocBook XSL stylesheets
---------------------------------------------------------------
The DocBook XSL Stylesheets distribution is just a directory full of
text files and you can switch between releases by changing the
directory name in the system XML catalog.

To upgrade to the latest docbook-xsl stylesheets without having to
wait for the Debian `docbook-xsl` package:

- Download the latest docbook-xsl tarball from
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/docbook/.

- Unzip the tarball to `/usr/share/xml/docbook/stylesheet/`:

  $ cd /usr/share/xml/docbook/stylesheet
  $ sudo tar -xzf /tmp/docbook-xsl-1.72.0.tar.gz
  
- Edit `/etc/xml/docbook-xsl.xml` catalog and replace occurences of
  the current stylesheets directory with the new one (in our example
  it would be `/usr/share/xml/docbook/stylesheet/docbook-xsl-1.72.0`.

  $ cd /etc/xml/
  $ sudo cp -p docbook-xsl.xml docbook-xsl.xml.ORIG
  $ sudo vi docbook-xsl.xml
