# Mizuho documentation formatting tool

Mizuho is a documentation formatting tool, best suited for small to
medium-sized documentation. One writes documentation in plain text
files, which Mizuho then converts to nicely formatted HTML.

Mizuho supports input files in [Asciidoc](http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/)
format. Asciidoc is a text formatting tool, used by e.g. Git for its
documentation. Thanks to Asciidoc, Mizuho supports a large number of formatting
options.

### Under the hood

Mizuho is actually a wrapper around Asciidoc. Asciidoc itself can only
generate single-page XHTML output. Mizuho extends Asciidoc by providing
multi-page XHTML output support and support for multiple templates.

## Features and highlights

 * You can output the documentation in a single XHTML file, or in multiple
   XHTML files (one per chapter).
 * Output is fully customizable via ERB templates.
 * Based on Asciidoc and supports all Asciidoc formatting commands.
 * Comes bundled with Asciidoc so you don't have to install it yourself. Mizuho
   Just Works(tm) out-of-the-box.

## Requirements

 * hpricot (`gem install hpricot`)
 * Python (because Asciidoc is written in Python)
 * [GNU Source-highlight](http://www.gnu.org/software/src-highlite/), if you
   want syntax highlighting support

## Installation

Download the source tarball from [Mizuho's Github page](http://github.com/FooBarWidget/mizuho/tree/master).
Extract it, then run:

    gem build mizuho.gemspec
    gem install mizuho-x.x.x.gem

where 'x.x.x' is the version number.

Do **not** use Github's autogenerated gem, because Github's gem creation
service has a bug which causes binaries inside gems to become non-functional.

## Usage

First, read the Asciidoc manual to learn the input file format:
http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/userguide.html

Next, write an input file and save it in a .txt file.

Finally, convert the .txt file to a single XHTML file with Mizuho, with the
default template:

    mizuho input.txt

This will generate 'input.html'. Or, you can convert it to multiple XHTML files
that also have a different look:

    mizuho input.txt --template manualsonrails --multi-page

Take a look at the 'templates' directory for available templates.

## Credits

This tool is named after Kazami Mizuho from the 2003 anime 'Onegai Teacher'.
